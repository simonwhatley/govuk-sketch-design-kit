# About the GOV.UK Sketch design kit
This is a design kit for [sketchapp](https://sketchapp.com/) to help in the design of UK Government digital services.

The kit provides a simple way to make static mockups that look like pages on GOV.UK. Used in conjunction with services like [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) and [Marvel](https://marvelapp.com/), these static mockups can be made into interactive prototypes for user research.

# Requirements
- [Sketchapp](https://sketchapp.com/)
- GDS Transport web font (a variant of [Transport New](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/transport-new/))

_The GDS Transport font files are licensed for use on the www.gov.uk, *.service.gov.uk and *.blog.gov.uk domains only. For services publicly available on different domains, use an alternative font like Arial._
